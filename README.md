# Duncan Robertson, Exercise2

I have no previous knowledge of Go, so taught myself this all from scratch. 

I'm happy with how I got on, the only issue is the final task. 

It will only run successfully with this current data set - which ends with and array of 3 uuids.

In the spirit of learning, I would be very interested in seeing a more robust solution!

# to run this:

     go run exercise2.go
